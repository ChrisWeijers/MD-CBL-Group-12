# 🚓 Police Force Allocation Prediction Model for the Metropolitan Police

This project aims to predict the amount of police officers needed in each LSOA in London, to best reduce the amount of burglaries. The model first predicts the number of burglaries expected each month in every LSOA across London. Based on these predictions, it estimates the number of policing hours required in each area to minimize burglary rates effectively.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

    Navigate to your desired directory and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChrisWeijers/MD-CBL-Group-12.git
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**:

    Navigate into the project directory and install all required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Download Police Data**:

    We used crime data from [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk). Since the specific dataset used in this project is not directly downloadable in a single click from the website, we've made it available via Google Drive for convenience. 

    [Download the data from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_W5TvYWFbiOBpO7Yk_TZkhqYYyT6Q00b?usp=share_link) 

    After downloading, place the file in the following directory, and ensist it has the name 'Original Dataset':
    ```bash
    data/Crimes/
    ```
You are now fully set to run the project!
## Running the project

To run all components of the project, including data gathering, processing, cleaning, formatting, estimation, model training, and dashboard creation, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python run.py
```
This will take roughly 30-45 minutes, and automatically opens the dashboard. 

## Scripts Overview

### 1. Data Collection
- `data_download.py`: Downloads raw datasets from Google Drive.

### 2. 📁data: Enriching with External Data
All data is preprocessed, cleaned, formatted and estimated in the `data/` directory. 
```

└── Time_encoding/               # sine/cosine month encoding
```

### 3. 📁XGBoost_models: Burglary Prediction Models
- `all_data_xgboost.py`: Trains model and predicts monthly burglary count.
- `all_data_xgboost_test.py`: Trains and test the model.

### 4. 📁app: Dashboard Preparation
- `Dashboard_GeoJSONCombine.py`: Merges shapefiles into a single GeoJSON for mapping.
- `DashLeafletNew.py`: Generates an interactive dashboard displaying burglary count predictions and policing hours distribution by LSOA or ward.
